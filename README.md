# Cat Management Service (Effect-TS)

This project is a TypeScript application built using the `effect-ts` library for managing a collection of cat data. It demonstrates a layered architecture and common patterns used in `effect-ts` applications.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories and files:

-   **`src/domain/`**: Contains the core data models and types.
    -   `cats.ts`: Defines the `Cat` schema (ID, name, age, breed) and the `CatId` branded type.
    -   `errors.ts`: (Assumed) Defines custom error types like `CatNotFoundError` used across the application.
-   **`src/data-access/`**: Handles data persistence and retrieval logic.
    -   `cats-data.ts`: Implements the data access layer for cats. It currently uses an in-memory `HashMap` managed by an `effect-ts/Ref` for storing cat data. Provides functions like `findById`, `persist`, `findAll`, and `removeById`.
-   **`src/services/`**: Contains the business logic of the application.
    -   `cats.ts`: Implements the service layer for cat operations. It wraps the `cats-data` functions, adds logging, and exposes these operations as an injectable `Cats` service using `Context.Tag`.
-   **`src/index.ts`**: The main entry point of the application. It sets up the application layers (merging `CatsLayer` and `CatsDataLayer`), demonstrates example usage of the `catsService`, and integrates with `@effect/experimental/DevTools` for debugging.
-   **`package.json`**: Defines project metadata, dependencies (`effect`, `@effect/experimental`, `@effect/platform-node`), and scripts.
-   **`tsconfig.json`**: TypeScript compiler configuration.
-   **`biome.json`**: (Assumed) Configuration for the Biome formatter/linter.

## Setup and Running

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Open your terminal in the project root and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the Application:**
    To execute the main application script (`src/index.ts`), run:
    ```bash
    npx ts-node src/index.ts
    ```
    This will run the example code in `index.ts`, which might include operations like finding a cat and logging it to the console. The application also attempts to connect to the Effect DevTools WebSocket if available.

## Development

(Details about development tools, linting, testing, etc., can be added here as the project evolves.)

## Improvement Suggestions

This project provides a solid foundation. Here are some suggestions for potential improvements and future development:

*   **Persistent Data Store:**
    *   Currently, the application uses an in-memory `HashMap`. For a production application, replace this with a persistent data store like PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or a cloud-based database. This would involve updating the `CatsData` layer to interact with the chosen database.
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling:**
    *   While `CatNotFoundError` is defined, error handling could be expanded. Consider adding more specific error types for different failure scenarios (e.g., validation errors, database connection errors) and ensuring consistent error handling patterns throughout the service and data access layers.
*   **Unit and Integration Tests:**
    *   Introduce a testing framework (like Jest, Vitest) and write unit tests for individual functions and modules (e.g., testing `Cat` schema validation, `CatsData` logic, `Cats` service methods).
    *   Add integration tests to verify the interaction between different layers (e.g., service layer with the data access layer).
*   **Develop an API:**
    *   Expose the cat management functionalities through a well-defined API (e.g., RESTful API using Express.js with `effect-ts` integrations, or a GraphQL API). This would allow external clients to interact with the service.
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   Add robust input validation at the service layer or API boundary to ensure data integrity before processing requests. This can be done using `effect-ts/Schema` or other validation libraries.
*   **Configuration Management:**
    *   Implement a configuration management solution (e.g., using environment variables or configuration files) for settings like database connection details, API ports, etc.
*   **Enhanced Logging:**
    *   Expand logging capabilities. While `effect-ts` provides powerful logging, structure logs and include more contextual information for better observability.
*   **Dependency Management in `index.ts`:**
    *   The `index.ts` file currently merges `CatsLayer` and `CatsDataLayer` directly. For larger applications, consider more sophisticated dependency injection patterns or layer composition strategies provided by `effect-ts` for better modularity.
